Even after the outer gate is plugged, they strangely encounter no opposition. The mission progresses smoothly until Armin Arlert, highly suspicious of the enemy's absence, discovers distressing signs of a potential scheme against them. \n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 follows Eren as he vows to take back everything that was once his. Alongside him, the Survey Corps strive\u2014through countless sacrifices\u2014to carve a path towards victory and uncover the secrets locked away in the Yeager family's basement.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 adapts content from volumes 18-22 of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.", "season": "spring", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "00:10", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1499, "type": "anime", "name": "Techno Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1499/Techno_Sound"}, {"mal_id": 1557, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 858, "type": "anime", "name": "Wit Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Survival", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}}, "_timestamp": 1767038810.302248, "_is_permanent": true}
