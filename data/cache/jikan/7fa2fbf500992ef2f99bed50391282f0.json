Reiner Braun uses his own powers in a desperate bid to hold off Eren's own militaristic force, and his fellow Eldians\u2014children Falco Grice and Gabi Braun\u2014struggle to survive in the unfolding chaos.\n\nElsewhere, Eren's childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert remain imprisoned alongside Eren's former Survey Corps companions, all disturbed by Eren's monstrous transformation.
